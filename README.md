# AR_Graffiti

This repository contains the concept note **AR_Graffiti.pdf**, developed for the entrepreneurial competition *"Making Tech Fun Again"* organised by **Nothing**, led by Carl Pei.

## About the Idea
The competition emphasised how technology has recently lost its sense of fun, becoming more about utility and exploitation rather than creativity. **AR_Graffiti** was my proposed solution to this challenge.

**AR_Graffiti** introduces playful and engaging ways to blend art and technology through Augmented Reality. It opens new possibilities for:
- **Artists** to create interactive digital graffiti in physical spaces.
- **Educational institutions** to make learning more immersive and enjoyable.

## Why It Matters
This idea aims to restore the *joy* in using technology, encouraging creativity, collaboration, and explorationâ€”making tech feel fun again.
